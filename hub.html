            // Healthcare System (Q1-Q17)
            { id: "Q1", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Is every citizen in Japan covered by health insurance?", answer: "Yes, Japan has implemented a universal health insurance system since 1961, ensuring that all citizens are enrolled in some form of public health insurance. The system comprises various schemes, including: • Employees' Health Insurance: Designed for company employees. • National Health Insurance: Aimed at self-employed individuals, pensioners, and others not covered by employment-based insurance. • Medical Care System for the Elderly Aged 75 and Over: Specifically for individuals aged 75 and above.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Universal Healthcare Overview.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q2", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What percentage of medical expenses do patients typically pay out of pocket in Japan?", answer: "Public health insurance in Japan covers approximately 70% of medical costs, and patients are generally responsible for the remaining 30%. (For children and the elderly, the co-payment rate varies between 10% and 30%.) Reimbursement rates for medical services and drug prices are determined by the Central Social Insurance Medical Council (Chuikyo), under the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Chuikyo includes experts beyond HCPs, so decisions reflect broader social perspectives.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Healthcare Payment Systems.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q3", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Is there an upper limit to out-of-pocket payments for medical expenses in Japan?", answer: "Yes. The High-Cost Medical Expense Benefit sets a monthly upper limit (based on income) for out-of-pocket payments per institution; amounts above the limit are reimbursed. This lowers financial barriers, so study designs should also consider non-economic burdens (time, family support). Because patients can easily use multiple institutions, anticipate multi-touchpoint care paths rather than a linear pathway.", relatedPdfs: ["High-Cost Medical Benefits Japan.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q4", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Does the design of the healthcare payment system influence behaviors in clinical practice?", answer: "Yes. Examples include additional reimbursement points for home healthcare and limits on inpatient days, which shape clinical practice and inter-facility cooperation. Whether a service is reimbursed often acts as a strong motivator in care and research adoption.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Healthcare Payment Incentives.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q5", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Is access to healthcare providers in Japan open and flexible?", answer: "Yes. Patients can visit specialists and large hospitals freely without a referral. This \"free access system\" is a distinctive feature of Japanese healthcare with fewer restrictions than many countries.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Free Access Healthcare System.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q6", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What challenges arise when anyone can freely access large hospitals or specialists?", answer: "Free access leads to crowded outpatient departments at major hospitals and duplication of consultations/tests, wasting resources. For pathways and market entry, select carefully which level to target (clinic, mid-sized hospital, large hospital).", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Healthcare Access Challenges.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q7", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Does Japan have a primary care physician system?", answer: "There is no direct US-style GP/PCP system. Initial consultations are also handled by specialists. Patients may visit university/large hospitals without a referral (extra fees may apply). Be mindful of institutional differences and define inclusion criteria carefully.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Primary Care System Overview.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q8", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Are there restrictions on physicians' clinical practices or referral pathways in Japan?", answer: "Generally no strict restrictions; referrals and diagnoses are at the physician's discretion. Some large institutions (e.g., university hospitals) recommend referral letters.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Physician Practice Guidelines.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q9", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Are Japan's health insurance systems operated by private companies?", answer: "No. The health insurance system is operated by public entities such as the government and local municipalities, not private insurers.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Public Health Insurance Structure.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q10", category: "healthcare-system", question: "How are health insurance premiums determined in Japan?", answer: "Premiums are based on income and age. They may be deducted from salaries via employers or paid individually per local government billing. Amount/methods vary by occupation and age.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Health Insurance Premium Structure.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q11", category: "healthcare-system", question: "Is there a role for private health insurance in Japan?", answer: "Yes, as a supplement to public insurance (e.g., advanced medical care, private-room surcharges). Interviews with private insurers are generally unnecessary. Practical note: Japan's de facto \"payers\" are the ~30 members of Chuikyo; interviewing them is extremely difficult and outside standard recruiting.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Private Health Insurance Role.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q12", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What is the role of physicians and their influence on purchasing decisions in Japan?", answer: "Physicians not only treat patients but significantly influence selection/adoption of devices and pharmaceuticals, often collaborating with hospital management and procurement. Research should capture both physician and admin perspectives.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Physician Purchasing Influence.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q13", category: "healthcare-system", question: "How is the health checkup system implemented in Japan?", answer: "Employers must provide annual health checkups under the Industrial Safety and Health Act. Many individuals also undergo comprehensive \"Ningen Dock\" exams at personal expense.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Health Checkup System.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q14", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What tests are included in health checkups in Japan?", answer: "Typically: height, weight, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, vision/hearing, blood tests (liver, kidney, glucose, lipids), urinalysis, chest X-ray, ECG. Municipalities/workplaces may add cancer screenings.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Health Checkup Tests.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q15", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What follow-up system is in place if abnormalities are found during a health checkup?", answer: "Occupational physicians or public health nurses recommend follow-up and encourage detailed exams or specialist visits. Many companies maintain proactive follow-up systems.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Health Checkup Follow-up.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q16", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What characterizes price revisions for services and pharmaceuticals in Japan?", answer: "Fees and drug prices are reviewed every two years (moving toward annual), with strong cost-containment. Even high launch prices often face early special cuts—important for long-term revenue planning.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Drug Price Revision System.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q17", category: "healthcare-system", question: "What types of medical institutions exist in Japan?", answer: "Two-tier model: Hospitals (~70%) with 20+ beds; Clinics/Shinryojo (~30%) with <20 beds, often private and neighborhood-based. Japan has fewer mid-sized centers and many small facilities, complicating integrated management.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Medical Institution Types.pdf"] },

            // HCP Studies (Q18-Q32)
            { id: "Q18", category: "hcp-studies", question: "How do patients in Japan choose medical institutions?", answer: "Patients freely choose clinics or hospitals without referrals; severe cases may go directly to hospitals or university hospitals to see specialists. Japan lacks a strict \"gatekeeper\" sequence common in Western systems.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Patient Choice Patterns.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q19", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Hospital beds and medical equipment availability (e.g., MRI) in Japan?", answer: "Beds per capita are exceptionally high—over 4× the US. MRI installations/usage are ~8× the UK and ~1.3× the US. Hospital size and equipment availability are important sampling criteria.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Medical Equipment Availability.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q20", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Is there a formal GP/general medicine system?", answer: "Developing but early-stage versus the West. A general medicine board certification exists and is growing in urban hospitals, but practice remains highly specialty-based; comprehensive primary care physicians are still relatively few.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan General Medicine Development.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q21", category: "hcp-studies", question: "How are medical specialties categorized?", answer: "19 base categories (MHLW): internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, OB/GYN, psychiatry, dermatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, urology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, emergency medicine, anesthesiology, radiology, rehabilitation, pathology, clinical laboratory medicine, general medicine. Other targetable areas include respiratory, gastroenterology, endocrinology/diabetology, nephrology, hematology, neurology, rheumatology, etc. Verify specialty names used overseas actually exist in Japan (e.g., \"Pain Medicine\" is not a standalone specialty).", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Medical Specialties Classification.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q22", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Distinctive features of licensing and board certification?", answer: "With a medical license, physicians can claim any specialty; board certification is optional. Recruiting only board-certified specialists is not always feasible—confirm qualification needs during design.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Medical Licensing System.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q23", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Do physicians in Japan handle many consultations?", answer: "Yes. Doctors self-handle broad tasks (consults, paperwork, meetings, teaching, emergencies), concentrating workload. Outpatient visits per physician: Japan ~5,333 vs US ~1,538. Expect limited availability; be flexible in scheduling.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Physician Workload Analysis.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q24", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Do patients visit medical institutions frequently?", answer: "Yes. Average 11–14 outpatient visits/year per person (~2× OECD average), driven by shorter prescriptions (<30 days) and easy access. Assume multi-institution, multi-visit behaviors in design.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Patient Visit Patterns.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q25", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Are consultation times short? Why?", answer: "Typically 3–5 minutes per outpatient. Fee-for-service incentivizes volume. Messages/surveys must convey essentials quickly.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Consultation Time Analysis.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q26", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Workload differences: hospital vs clinic physicians?", answer: "Hospital physicians: longer hours, team care, night shifts; harder to schedule but highly specialized. Clinic physicians: more schedule autonomy and flexibility, though specialty scope may be limited by case mix.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Hospital vs Clinic Physicians.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q27", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Which physicians treat cancer patients?", answer: "Medical oncologists are relatively few; organ-specific surgeons (e.g., breast, GI, urology) often manage from surgery through chemotherapy, supporting continuity of care and patient reassurance.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Cancer Treatment Physicians.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q28", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Number/role of medical oncologists?", answer: "Certification began in 2006; as of 2020 about 1,455 specialists, with many hospitals lacking them. They mainly handle new therapies (immunotherapy/targeted agents) and complex cases.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Medical Oncologists Role.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q29", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Central institutions for cancer care?", answer: "Designated Cancer Care Hospitals (MHLW), university hospitals, and the National Cancer Center (~393 facilities) serve as hubs for advanced care, clinical trials, and new therapy introduction.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Cancer Care Centers.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q30", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Adoption/dissemination of new cancer drugs?", answer: "After PMDA approval, ~6-month Early Post-marketing Phase Vigilance (EPPV) precedes wider adoption. Physicians are cautious, often awaiting guideline inclusion and experience at major hospitals before broad use.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan New Cancer Drug Adoption.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q31", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Importance of clinical guidelines?", answer: "Very high. Guidelines are the standard; off-guideline/off-label use is rare. Under national insurance, only guideline-concordant treatments are reimbursed.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Clinical Guidelines Importance.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q32", category: "hcp-studies", question: "Are physicians willing to participate in research?", answer: "Generally yes—if clearly \"for research only.\" Emphasize that it's market research, data are anonymized, and the aim is to understand real practice. Separate research from promotion to gain trust.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Physician Research Participation.pdf"] },

            // Patient Studies (Q33-Q51)
            { id: "Q33", category: "patient-studies", question: "How to design duration/format?", answer: "Keep burden low. Online surveys: 20–30 minutes. Interviews: 60–90 minutes max. Online (Zoom/Teams) is preferred due to no travel time.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Survey Design Guidelines.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q34", category: "patient-studies", question: "Is localization necessary?", answer: "Yes. Use natural Japanese. Use domestic generic/brand drug names; common Japanese disease terms/abbreviations (e.g., RA, HbA1c); use Japan-standard units (mg/dL).", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Localization Requirements.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q35", category: "patient-studies", question: "Is honoraria culturally acceptable for physicians?", answer: "Yes. It's standard and considered ethical to fairly compensate time/expertise; common in research and pharma industries in Japan.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Research Honoraria Guidelines.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q36", category: "patient-studies", question: "Typical honoraria ranges for physicians?", answer: "Interviews: several tens of thousands of JPY per hour. Examples—30 min: JPY 10,000–15,000; 60 min: ~JPY 20,000–30,000. Quant surveys: several thousand JPY depending on time.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Honoraria Rates Guide.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q37", category: "patient-studies", question: "Payment method preferences?", answer: "Common: Amazon gift cards, cash, or bank transfer; checks are uncommon.

Avoid cancellations and be punctual—expected regardless of compensation.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Business Etiquette Healthcare.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q39", category: "patient-studies", question: "Are patients reluctant to participate?", answer: "Many are privacy-sensitive (history of large data breaches). From recruitment, clearly state anonymity, no PII collection, and statistical use only, to earn trust.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Patient Privacy Concerns.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q40", category: "patient-studies", question: "Handling sensitive/privacy-related questions?", answer: "Avoid unless necessary, or mark optional. Examples: income, education, family structure—forcing them causes refusals/dropouts and unreliable data. Provide \"Prefer not to answer\" options.", relatedPdfs: ["Navigating Privacy & Platforms in Japanese Patient Research.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q41", category: "patient-studies", question: "Common age groups in patient surveys?", answer: "Older adults (60–70+) dominate chronic disease surveys (diabetes, hypertension, COPD, cardiovascular). Ensure readability, comprehension, and low burden.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Patient Demographics Research.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q42", category: "patient-studies", question: "Adapting surveys for elderly patients?", answer: "Use larger fonts and simplified questions; favor desktop/laptop UI; consider paper/telephone options; sometimes need family/caregiver support or consent.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Elderly Patient Survey Design.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q43", category: "patient-studies", question: "Other considerations for patient surveys?", answer: "Non-economic burdens (time, congestion, need for accompaniment) can be major obstacles. Emphasize safety/efficacy, daily life considerations, and family cooperation—often valued more than direct financial benefits.", relatedPdfs: ["Japan Patient Survey Considerations.pdf"] },
            { id: "Q44", category: "patient-studies", question: "Main patient recruitment channels?", answer: "(1) Online patient panels—broad reach, but accurate screening is critical. (2) Social media—hashtags, patient influencers, communities (X, Instagram, Facebook).
