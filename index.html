<script id="faq-data" type="application/json">[{"id":"Q1","question":"Is every citizen in Japan covered by health insurance?","answer":"In Japan, all registered residents are required to enroll in public health insurance (either Employee's Health Insurance or National Health Insurance), ensuring universal coverage for necessary medical services.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q2","question":"What percentage of medical expenses do patients typically pay out of pocket in Japan?","answer":"Generally 30% of the medical fee is paid at the point of care (10–30% depending on age and income categories), with the remainder covered by public insurance.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q3","question":"Is there an upper limit to out-of-pocket payments for medical expenses in Japan?","answer":"Yes. The High-Cost Medical Expense Benefit sets a monthly cap on patient cost sharing, with thresholds varying by age and income; amounts exceeding the cap are reimbursed.","categories":["System","Patients"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q4","question":"Does the design of the healthcare payment system influence behaviors in clinical practice?","answer":"Yes. Uniform fee schedules and insurance rules shape practice patterns (e.g., test ordering, referral behaviors), and operational constraints influence daily workflow and time allocation.","categories":["System","HCP","Operations"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q5","question":"Is access to healthcare providers in Japan open and flexible?","answer":"Yes. Patients can generally visit their preferred facility without strict gatekeeping; however, large hospitals may require referral letters or additional fees for first visits.","categories":["System","Patients"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q6","question":"What challenges are associated with a system where anyone can freely access large hospitals or specialists?","answer":"It can cause overcrowding at tertiary hospitals, longer waiting times, and potential inefficiency; triage by referrals and differential fees are used to encourage appropriate access.","categories":["System","Patients","Operations"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q7","question":"Does Japan have a primary care physician system?","answer":"Not in a strict gatekeeping sense. Many clinics function as de facto primary care, but patients retain freedom to visit specialists directly.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q8","question":"Are there any restrictions on physicians' clinical practices or referral pathways in Japan?","answer":"Clinical freedom is respected, but institutional protocols and insurance rules (including documentation requirements) guide referrals and certain procedures.","categories":["System","HCP"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q9","question":"Are Japan’s health insurance systems operated by private companies?","answer":"The core schemes are public: Employee-based and municipal National Health Insurance. Private insurers play a supplemental role rather than running the public schemes.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q10","question":"How are health insurance premiums determined in Japan?","answer":"Employee plan premiums are income-based and shared by employers and employees; National Health Insurance premiums are set by municipalities considering income, household size, and assets.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q11","question":"Is there a role for private health insurance in Japan?","answer":"Yes—mainly as supplemental coverage for hospitalization cash benefits or non-covered services; it does not replace the public system.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q12","question":"What is the role of physicians and their influence on purchasing decisions in Japan?","answer":"Physicians strongly influence treatment choice and hospital purchasing decisions, especially for device-intensive or specialty areas; however, guidelines and formularies also shape choices.","categories":["HCP","Operations","System"],"primary":"HCP"},
{"id":"Q13","question":"How is the health checkup system implemented in Japan?","answer":"It is supported by public programs and employers. Periodic checkups (including cancer screening by age) are encouraged with follow-up pathways when abnormalities are detected.","categories":["System","Operations","Patients"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q14","question":"What types of tests are included in health checkups in Japan?","answer":"Typical sets include physical exam, blood/urine tests, blood pressure, ECG, chest X-ray; age/risk-based items can include GI endoscopy, mammography, and others.","categories":["System","Patients"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q15","question":"What follow-up system is in place if abnormalities are found during a health checkup in Japan?","answer":"Participants receive referral recommendations or letters to appropriate facilities; follow-up is typically coordinated by clinics/companies, with insurance coverage applying to diagnostic care.","categories":["System","Patients","Operations"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q16","question":"What are the characteristics of price revisions for medical services and pharmaceuticals in Japan?","answer":"National fee schedules and drug prices undergo periodic revisions (usually every two years), affecting reimbursement levels and prescribing/uptake patterns.","categories":["System","Timeline"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q17","question":"What types of medical institutions exist in Japan?","answer":"University/tertiary hospitals, general hospitals, specialty centers, and private clinics; roles differ for acute, specialized, and community care.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q18","question":"How do patients in Japan choose medical institutions?","answer":"By convenience, reputation, specialty availability, and referrals; universal coverage reduces price differences at point of care, so access and perceived quality matter.","categories":["Patients","System"],"primary":"Patients"},
{"id":"Q19","question":"What is the number of hospital beds and the availability of medical equipment (such as MRI machines) in Japan?","answer":"Japan has a high number of hospital beds and abundant imaging equipment per capita compared with many countries; availability varies by region and facility type.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q20","question":"Is there a formal system for general practitioners (GPs) or general medicine physicians in Japan?","answer":"A formal GP gatekeeping system is not pervasive; \"general internal medicine\" and primary-care-style clinics fulfill first-contact roles, with referrals to specialists as needed.","categories":["System"],"primary":"System"},
{"id":"Q21","question":"How are medical specialties categorized in Japan?","answer":"Specialties follow national training boards (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics) with sub-specialty certification; institutions may have different departmental arrangements.","categories":["HCP","System"],"primary":"HCP"},
{"id":"Q22","question":"Are there any distinctive features in the Japanese system for medical licensing and board certification?","answer":"National licensing is standardized; specialty board certification has undergone reforms for quality assurance and training program accreditation.","categories":["HCP","System"],"primary":"HCP"},
{"id":"Q23","question":"Do physicians in Japan see a high number of patients or handle a large number of consultations per doctor?","answer":"Yes, particularly in outpatient clinics; this impacts consultation time and scheduling preferences for research participation.","categories":["HCP","Operations"],"primary":"HCP"},
